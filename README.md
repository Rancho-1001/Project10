# Project10
Implemented the Aces Up card game with Python.  

The main file with the rules of the game and its implementation is the proj10.py file.
The program imports the card.py file which contains the code for the class for the card and Deck objects. 

The other .py files are used to check for the functionality of the various functions in the proj10.py file.
The .txt files are used to play the game. They give sample game play and the results to expect (test cases)
